# Week 4: Advanced Java Concepts & Testing Tools

Welcome to Week 4 of our Java learning path! This week we dive into advanced core Java topics such as Generics, Collections, Exception Handling, and Java I/O Streams. We also explore regular expressions, unit testing with JUnit, and Java 8's most powerful features like Lambda expressions and Streams API.
